    <p> My original sketches were more based on visuals that I found on Pinterest. I really liked the colorful elements of those sketches, but I wanted to relate the optical illusion to something that I am currently interested in. I am also currently taking a Touch Designer class, where there is a texture that is very similar to the Perlin noise texture. 

        I was debating between whether or not to have colors or keep it “true” to how the Perlin noise typically looks like, but I ultimately chose color because I liked it more. 
        
        I will say, that because I was referencing a tutorial, I didn’t really have a hard time “fine-tuning” my illusion, but I wanted to make sure that I understood each element I was implementing and including in my sketch.
        
        I know Perlin noise is applied in CGI and gradient noise visual effects. It allows for more natural-looking computer visual elements as it imitates the random appearance of textures in nature. I have always liked the “smoky” quality of Perlin noise and have used it in my own works before.
