# ARE YOU CHRONICALLY ONLINE???

**ARE YOU CHRONICALLY ONLINE???** — a slightly chaotic quiz inspired by the digital age, meme culture, and the rise of internet-induced existential crises.

## 🌀 What Is This?

I was originally inspired from a realization I had growing up: the way we talk about technology usage has shifted drastically. I remember sitting in doctor’s offices as a kid, looking at posters that warned about "too much screen time." Over the years, those warnings changed — “only X hours with technology” turned into “only X hours, aside from homework…”

And now? We're always online (or at least I feel like I am). But when does being online turn into being **chronically online**?

I want to explore this question through a quiz — a playful, aesthetic deep dive into your online habits, internet addictions, and whether you've slowly morphed into a meme-fueled dopamine chaser.

## 💻 What's Inside?

A website and interactive quiz that captures the feeling of being lost in the scroll. 

There is also a little surpise at the end of the quiz! (screenshots of my own messages where I admit I am chronically online)

## 🧠 Quiz Questions (A Sneak Peek)

- How often are you online for school or work?
- How often are you online *outside* of school or work?
- Do you unwind by watching YouTube, Netflix, TikToks, or endless Spotify loops?
- Are you the type to reply to notifications instantly — always "available"?
- Is your screen time embarrassingly high (but you don’t want to talk about it)?
- Do you obsess over how you look online, your posts, your feeds?
- Do real-life responsibilities sometimes take a back seat to your digital life?
- Do you feel restless or anxious when you’re offline for too long?

## 🎯 Goal

I wanted to create a playful but thoughtful reflection on what it means to be *chronically online* — blending humor, internet culture, and self-awareness. This project is also an ongoing exploration of how our relationships with technology have evolved, and where we’re heading next.

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- memes

## 🚧 Future Iteration (AKA if I had more time...)

- I want make the website *EVEN* more chaotic-- more memes and crazy visuals
- My friends (during the prototype share out in class) had the cute idea to potentially have easter eggs where if the user presses the memes then it could also accumulate points that way
