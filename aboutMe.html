        i am someone who likes a wide range of things. 
        i like consuming media, whether that is art, poetry, movies, lectures...
        anything where i can listen or see and "take in". 
        before coming to design school, i was planning to go into nursing or 
        something biomedical, because i had a deep interest in learning about the body. 
        i have pivoted that interest into a desire to understand what makes good 
        design vs great design--the psychology behind it. it introduced me to uiux and 
        understanding design beyond function and aesthetics, but what keeps people 
        engaged.
