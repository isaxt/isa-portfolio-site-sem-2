# ARE YOU CHRONICALLY ONLINE???

Welcome to **ARE YOU CHRONICALLY ONLINE???** — a slightly chaotic quiz inspired by the digital age, meme culture, and the rise of internet-induced existential crises.

## 🌀 What Is This?

This project was born from a realization I had growing up: the way we talk about technology usage has shifted drastically. I remember sitting in doctor’s offices as a kid, looking at posters that warned about "too much screen time." Over the years, those warnings changed — “only X hours with technology” turned into “only X hours, aside from homework…”

And now? We're always online. But when does being online turn into being **chronically online**?

This project explores that question through a quiz — a playful, aesthetic deep dive into your online habits, internet addictions, and whether you've slowly morphed into a meme-fueled dopamine chaser.

## 💻 What's Inside?

A website and interactive quiz that captures the feeling of being lost in the scroll. 

## 🧠 Quiz Questions (A Sneak Peek)

- How often are you online for school or work?
- How often are you online *outside* of school or work?
- Do you unwind by watching YouTube, Netflix, TikToks, or endless Spotify loops?
- Are you the type to reply to notifications instantly — always "available"?
- Is your screen time embarrassingly high (but you don’t want to talk about it)?
- Do you obsess over how you look online, your posts, your feeds?
- Do real-life responsibilities sometimes take a back seat to your digital life?
- Do you feel restless or anxious when you’re offline for too long?

## 🎯 Goal

To create a playful but thoughtful reflection on what it means to be *chronically online* — blending humor, internet culture, and self-awareness. This project is also an ongoing exploration of how our relationships with technology have evolved, and where we’re heading next.
