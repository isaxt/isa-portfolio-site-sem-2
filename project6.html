    <h2> reflection</h2>
    <p> I realized that I am someone who likes to "not be in silence", even if that means using filler words or other "sayings" to fill the space. I am not even sure if I tracked all of the times I used the filler words because I use them SO MUCH. I think when I am talking it is not as big of a deal, especially if it is in a casual setting, but I just need to be more aware and conscious of HOW MUCH I use the words. 

        I am someone who doesn't like to be in "silence", so I tend to use "fillers" so that I don't have to be in complete silence. In this sketch, the canvas is split into 7 sections vertically (for each day), and the viewer must click through each seventh of canvas to see the number of fillers I used in conversation and text throughout the 7 days in the form of bubbles containing random fillers or other phrases that I use alot. Each day is color coded, and viewers are able to continuously click until it reaches the number I tracked for each respective day.
        
        *Nothing will pop up in the 6th section of the canvas because I tracked 0 fillers for that day-- which kinda makes sense because I was mostly alone for the day except calling my parents*
